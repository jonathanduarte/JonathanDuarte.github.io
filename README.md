## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Jekyll is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it's just a tool to let you have **all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database**. This means hosting is *extremely easy* and *scalable* since all you're doing is managing a bunch of files.

This is just a starter theme with the latest bootstrap 3.x version!


## Getting Started

To start coding just clone this repo, read the tutorials and make it yours, giving your style and touch.
We would love to hear from you and the result of your work. Make a pull request to this document with the link of your own blog based on this.

```

Then run Jekyll (if you don't have Jekyll installed, see the tutorial or docs):
